  * Got vim-pandoc setup after Chris showed me the light. Changed my .vimrc to change the tabbing on pandoc filetypes to 4 spaces after both Chris and I ran into issues where rendering a markdown file to pdf with Pandoc did not indent the nested bullets correctly.
  * Started this thing. Going to try public on Github for a while. It will prevent me from putting work sensitive information on here, but I think I can be very generic in those regards.
  * Grabbed Neverwinter Nights for free on gog.com. Love that game! Spent some time getting wine setup on my Mac and actually got NWN to run. I probably should have documented the steps, but I pretty much followed this [excellent tutorial](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/).
  * Just pushed the initial commit of this file, and github doesn't do well with the 4 space indent. It interpreted this list as a code block. I commented out the autocmd for now. I will have to figure this out in the future.

  * Setting up my new MBP at work and figured I should document what I did to setup a brand new clean environment:
    * Common steps:
      * The box builder guy at work already had Chrome and iTerm2 installed so I didn't have to start with these.
      * Turned on the lower right hot corner to turn on my screen saver. Security was already setup to lock the screen when the screen saver comes on.
      * Used Airdrop to move over my private and public ssh keys from my other work box. I know you shouldn't do this, but the Ops team here encourages it because it is very hard to get them to distribute a new public key for you. I made sure the .ssh dir is mode 700 and the keys were 600 for the private and 644 for the public.
      * Used Airdrop to move over my password database file. Installed [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/).
      * Installed Dropbox, and then pointed KeePass to my dropbox password database and deleted the password database I copied over.
      * Installed [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and installed the following:
        * fish
        * wget
        * vim
        * git
        * go
        * tmux
        * ctags
        * cmake
        * pandoc
          * `ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-darwin/pdflatex /usr/local/bin`
          * `ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-darwin/xelatex  /usr/local/bin`
        * Caskroom/cask/mactex
        * cask install font-hack (*Not sure why this is different?*)
        * Caskroom/cask/virtualbox
        * Caskroom/cask/vagrant
        * Caskroom/cask/postman
      * Change the default profile on iterm2 to use the font hack at 12pt regular.
        * I am now trying out [FIRA Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) now. This needs to be downloaded, installed, and selected in the profile on iterm2.
      * Cloned my [dotfiles](https://github.com/pneisen/dotfiles) from Github.
        * `cd ~/dotfiles; ./setup.sh`
        * `cd ~/dotfiles/vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe; ./install.py --clang-completer --gocode-completer`
      * Download and install [Adium](https://adium.im/). Will need a new [Google App Password](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords).
      * Install Chrome extensions:
        * [cVim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh)
        * [Markdown Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-reader/gpoigdifkoadgajcincpilkjmejcaanc)
          * Check *Allow access to file URLs*
          * Associate .md files with Chrome in finder
        * [Sourcegraph](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-reader/gpoigdifkoadgajcincpilkjmejcaanc)
      * Download and install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).
      * Migrate documents, files, etc.
    * Work only steps
      * Download and install [SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html).
        * Copy over oracle files from the old mac.
      * Download and install [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps).

  * Ran into an issue compiling YouCompleteMe on Ubuntu. Cmake could not find the pythonlibs. `sudo apt-get install python-dev` fixed it up.

### 2016-12-12
  * Chris sent me this gem: [Vimwiki](http://vimwiki.github.io/). Looks pretty neat, I want to play with it and see if I could use it.
  * [vim-pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc) isn't caught up to the 1.18 version of Pandoc on Homebrew. This breaks some things like generating the pdf from within Vim using a command like this: `:Pandoc pdf -V geometry=margin=0.5in -V mainfont=Arial -V fontsize=12pt`
  * I also noticed that vim-pandoc remaps your jk keys to work with soft wraps, but it doesn't do line end and line start. I will have to add those myself. #todo
  * Worked on a fish shell function for managing my .plan editing. It is going to:
    * Check to see if the .plan repo has been cloned. If not, clone it in the usual spot
    * pushd the current directory and move to the .plan directory
    * Pull down the latest .plan from Github
    * Open the README.md in vim
    * Check to see if I made any changes: `git diff --shortstat 2> /dev/null | tail -n1`
    * If changes, commit using the date in the commit message.
    * Push to Github.
    * popd back to the previous directory

### 2016-12-13
  * Finished up my .plan fish function. The source is here: [.plan.fish](https://github.com/pneisen/dotfiles/blob/master/config/fish/functions/.plan.fish)
  * Fish's caching of settings bit me today. I was changing functions and not seeing the changes. I had to delete the ~/.config/fish/fishd* file to have it refresh the settings. I will look for a better way, but this works for now.
    * I figured this out. A `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish` will do the trick. I added an abbreviation named *reload* that does this.
  * I don't know that lib/pq-timeouts is needed now that Go 1.8 supports contexts for sql drivers. I'm going to have to look more into this. #todo

### 2016-12-14
  * Read a few quotes off [Cat-v](http://cat-v.org/) that I loved and were inspiring to me:
    * "Only the mediocre are always at their best." -- Jean Giraudoux
    * "Eventually, I decided that thinking was not getting me very far and it was time to try building." -- Rob Pike
    * "Share your knowledge. Itâ€™s a way to achieve immortality." -- Dalai Lama
  * The *reload* abbreviation isn't going to work. Forgot that *reload* is an upstart command.
    * Fixed this. Changed it to *fish_reload*.

### 2016-12-15
  * Keith sent me this [xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1768/). Some good advice there.
  * Chris and I were both looking for a way to color or underline links in a pandoc generated pdf. I found the urlcolor option for LaTeX. This is how I am generating pdfs now: `pandoc -V geometry=margin=0.5in -V mainfont=Arial -V fontsize=12pt -V urlcolor=cyan -f markdown_github -o test.pdf test.md`
  * Read a Hacker News comment about **urgency** vs **importance**. Their example was planning things way ahead so you don't get caught up in day to day urgencies. "You can lose a random Saturday to your todo list, but if you have tickets to fly to Europe, that is going to take precedence." Makes me think I need to plan some camping and activities now for this summer. #todo
  * Wow! Gitlab has a [container registry](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/05/23/gitlab-container-registry/). #look

### 2016-12-19
  * My power went out at home for about 4 hours yesterday and it killed the settings on the DSL modem. I had to use my wife's phone to look up the instructions since I have the data turned off on my phone at Ting. I decided to document what I did to fix it in case I need it again:
    * Hold the reset button on the modem as you power it up. Not sure if this was needed, but I couldn't get to the configuration before I did it.
    * Plug my laptop in via ethernet and navigate to http://192.168.0.1
    * On the advanced tab, set to "transparent bridge"
    * Turn off wireless on the modem
  * Hugo just had a [big update](http://bepsays.com/en/2016/12/19/hugo-018/). Seems easier to understand. I need to look into it. #look

### 2016-12-20
  * Started back on learning Haskell and when I fired up vim I got this error: *ghcmod: ghc-mod is not executable!* I had to do a `stack install ghc-mod` to install ghc-mod via stack.

### 2017-01-01
  * Finished reading "The Soul of a New Machine" by Tracy Kidder. Good story but what I found the most interesting was the overall discussion about how knowledge workers are motivated. Two quotes particularly spoke to me: "In The Nature of Gothic, John Ruskin decries the tendency of the industrial age to fragment work into tasks so trivial that they are fit to be performed only by the equivalent of slave labor" and "Among the terms used to describe their malaise are declining technical challenge; misutilization; limited freedom of action; tight control of working patterns. No one who made it through the Eagle project could in fairness have raised such objections. The work was divided but it was not cut to ribbons. Everyone got responsibility for some important part of the machine, many got to choose their piece, and each portion required more than routine labor." Those two thoughts identify the problem I have with agile development.

  * "My generation certainly had the mind-set that in order to get a "good job," one had to attend college, but what I've learned since is that many of these so-called good jobs are just a sentencing to a sort of cubicle soul-death with a paycheck attached." - Nick Offerman

### 2017-01-26
  * I was reading an exploration into the go compiler and they mentioned `go tool objdump app` will dump the entire assembly for your app.
  * `go build -gcflags -m main.go` is interesting too as it will tell you all the optimizations it is making during the build.

  * "My father never went to college so it was really important I go to college. After college, I called him long distance and said, now what? My dad didn't know." - Chuck Palahniuk

  * "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." - Frank Herbert
  * "The people who can destroy a thing, they control it." - Frank Herbert

  * Redid the tubeless on the Stumpjumper and rotated the tires.

  * I seemed to have forgot a handy way to do search and replace in Vim. After teaching it to myself again I figured I would document it here:
    * Use / to search for the term I want to search and replace.
    * gn operates on the currently selected search text, so cgn will change the currently selected search text. Use cgn to change the text if desired.
    * Use n or N to navigate to the next/previous search term and if you want to change it, use . to make the same change you made before. Continue to use n or N to navigate the terms.
