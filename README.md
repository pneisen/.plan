  * Got vim-pandoc setup after Chris showed me the light. Changed my .vimrc to change the tabbing on pandoc filetypes to 4 spaces after both Chris and I ran into issues where rendering a markdown file to pdf with Pandoc did not indent the nested bullets correctly. 
  * Started this thing. Going to try public on Github for a while. It will prevent me from putting work sensitive information on here, but I think I can be very generic in those regards.
  * Grabbed Neverwinter Nights for free on gog.com. Love that game! Spent some time getting wine setup on my Mac and actually got NWN to run. I probably should have documented the steps, but I pretty much followed this [excellent tutorial](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/). 
  * Just pushed the initial commit of this file, and github doesn't do well with the 4 space indent. It interpreted this list as a code block. I commented out the autocmd for now. I will have to figure this out in the future.
